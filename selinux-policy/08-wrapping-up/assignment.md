    ### Wrapping up

    In this workshop we learned how to:
    - determine and configure the state of SELinux on a system as a whole and for an application in particular
    - understand the SELinux context of an object in terms of the user, role, and type
    - create a template for an SELinux policy for an application
    - find, interpret and remediate SELinux AVC denials for file system objects
    - find, interpret and remediate SELinux AVC denials for network access
    - combine the above into a policy that allows us to run a custom application in Enforcing mode.

    We hope that you enjoyed the workshop. Look for more security topics coming in future.
