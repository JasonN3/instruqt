title: Introduction to Extended Update Support
description: |-
  Whether you want more control over your lifecycle, need a longer support window, or are tied to a specific minor release, Extended Update Support (EUS) allows your Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers to stay on the same minor version for 2 years.

  # Tasks included in this scenario:
  * Identify current minor version and available versions of RHEL
  * Add EUS entitlement to a server
  * Update to the latest EUS release
