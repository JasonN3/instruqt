description: |+
  # Goal:

  After completing this scenario, users will be able to choose which version of a software package is enabled on a system from an application stream.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Verify the availability of an application stream
  * Install software managed as an application stream
  * Change to a different version of software from an application stream
  * List all available software managed as application streams

  # Example Usecase:

  A web application being deployed on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 requires ruby version 3.0.  Later, the application is updated and requires ruby version 3.1 be available on the machine.
