    After completing this scenario, users will be able to identify vulnerabilities that
    affect systems registered to Red Hat Insights using the Vulnerability tool. They will also
    learn how to remdediate these vulnerabilities. 

    # Concepts included in this scenario:
    * View Insights Vulnerability results that are reported for the system on cloud.redhat.com.
    * Apply a recommeded remediation for the system.
    * Validate that the remediation was successful.

    # Example Usecase:
    Systems are impacted by a new vulnerability which a remediation exists for.  
    Asministrators would like to apply specific fixes to their systems without the
    need for broader system updates.

# Gathering system information

This lab system is already registered with Red Hat's [https://cloud.redhat.com](Hybrid Cloud Console) using the Red Hat Cloud Connector `rhc`.  We can view its registration information with the following command.

```
rhc status
```

You should get output similar to this:

<pre class=file>
Connection status for rhel-d34db:

● Connected to Red Hat Subscription Management
● Connected to Red Hat Insights
● The Red Hat connector daemon is active

Manage your Red Hat connector systems: https://red.ht/connector

</pre>

You can see that the system's hostname is included in the output, in this case `rhel-d34db` your system will have a similarly formatted, but different name. You will need this hostname later, so jot it down.
