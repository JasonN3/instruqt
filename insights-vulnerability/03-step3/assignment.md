# Navigating the Insights service

Now that you have opened Red Hat Insights for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, you
will see a summary dashboard of all systems registered to your organization.

![Insights Homepage](../assets/insights-homepage-v2.png)

For this exercise we are going to generate a report that tells us where our fleet of systems sits in regards to un-remedieated vulnerabilities.  From the Insights dashboard, you should navivate to Vulnerabilities -> Reports on the left-hand side menu.  

![Navigate to Vulnerability Reports](../assets/insights-homepage-inventory-highlight.png)

Once you are on the Reports page, generate an Executive summary, and download the resulting PDF. This report is designed to provide you with a report that could be presented to management, summarizing the overall health of your RHEL fleet from a vulnerability standpoint.
