title: Building custom images with the Image Builder Service
description: |
  After completing this scenario, users will be able to define a Red Hat Enterprise Linux blueprint
  in the Red Hat Image Builder tool hosted on the Hybrid Cloud Console.  Then take the resulting 
  image and customize it for their needs.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Using the Image Builder Service to define a custom image
  * Using local tools to further customize the resulting image
  * Testing this image using a local virtual machine

  # Example Usecase:
  Your organization has specific requirements for their system builds, you would like to build 
  those requirements into a custom image that you can then deploy to your public cloud provider.
