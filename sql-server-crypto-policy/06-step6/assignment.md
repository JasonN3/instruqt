## Working with Transparent Data Encryption in SQL Server

Before we explore Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) in SQL Server, it's important to understand the
underlying key hierarchy used by SQL Server. Each layer is encrypted by the one above it â€“ the user data is encrypted by the database encryption key (DEK), which is a symmetric key, and the DEK is encrypted by the certificate, whose private key portion is encrypted by the master key, which is encrypted with a user-specified password.

Let's first open up the sqlcmd shell prompt connected to the master database. The master database contains all of the system level information for SQL Server. It gets created when the server instance of SQL Server is created.

```bash
/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P Redhat1! -d master -N -C
```

Use master database to setup the master encryption key.

```sql
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '1Password!'
```

The GO keyword is the default batch terminator in SQL Server, allowing a set of commands to run as a batch.

```sql
GO
```

> **NOTE:** It is recommended practice to backup the master key as soon as it is created, and store the backup in a secure, off-site location. To backup the master key, use the *BACKUP MASTER KEY* statement in SQL Server.

Create a certificate in the master database

```sql
CREATE CERTIFICATE MyServerCert WITH SUBJECT = 'My Database Encryption Key Certificate'
```

```sql
GO
```

Create a database called TestDB to be encrypted

```sql
CREATE DATABASE TestDB
```

```sql
GO
```

Switch to the TestDB database

```sql
USE TestDB
```

```sql
GO
```

Create database encryption key (DEK) with AES_256 algorithm and encrypted by server certificate. The DEK is designed to actually encrypt and decrypt the data in your data, log and backup files when you use TDE. The DEK is protected with a certificate. This can be a purchased or self-signed certificate, but in either case, the certificate must reside in the master database of the instance hosting the TDE encrypted database such as the certificate created in the previous step.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE ENCRYPTION KEY WITH ALGORITHM = AES_256 ENCRYPTION BY SERVER CERTIFICATE MyServerCert
```

```sql
GO
```

> **NOTE:** You will notice a warning message after creating the DEK to backup the certificate. In order protect the data from a failure event; make sure to back-up the certificate. It is recommended practice to backup the certificate as soon as it is created, and store the backup in a secure, off-site location. To backup the certificate, use the *BACKUP CERTIFICATE* statement in SQL Server.

Turn ON database encryption

```sql
ALTER DATABASE TestDB SET ENCRYPTION ON
```

```sql
GO
```

List the databases that are encrypted. Encrypted_state = 3 means these databases are in encrypted state

```sql
SELECT a.name from sys.dm_database_encryption_keys b join sys.databases a on a.database_id = b.database_id WHERE encryption_state = 3
```

```sql
GO
```

<pre class="file">
name
-----------------------------------------------
tempdb
TestDB
</pre>

The **tempdb** system database will be encrypted if any other database on the instance of SQL Server is encrypted by using TDE. This is because query processing in SQL Server could use tempdb  for sort spills and hash joins. In such cases, you also want tempdb to be encrypted along with the other encrypted databases.

You can exit the sqlcmd shell using the exit statement

```sql
exit
```
